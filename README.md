# DS4Windows

Like those other ds4tools, but sexier.

DS4Windows is an extract anywhere program that allows you to get the best
DualShock 4 experience on your PC. By emulating a Xbox 360 controller, many
more games are accessible.

This repository is a fork of the work of Jays2Kings and Ryochan7, mainly for create pull-request for Ryochan7's.
